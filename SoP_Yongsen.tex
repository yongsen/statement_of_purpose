\section{Reasons I want to do graduate work in this field.}
Statistics is an extremely interesting and useful field as it is a means by which we can further our understanding of the world. In fact, almost every decision we make is based on a (relative) likelihood which we loosely derive from our current understanding of the state of the world.

I have had positive research experiences with my thesis advisor and members of the Center for Intelligent Wireless Networking and Cooperative Control (i-WiN C2)\footnote{\url{http://wicnc.sjtu.edu.cn}}, where I am interning during the Summer of 2010. This, along with interesting coursework, has motivated me to continue into a Doctoral program in wireless networking.

I wish to contribute my talents to the application of statistical analysis and the development of new statistical methods in areas that improve the conditions of life. To fulfill this goal, I must be engaged in basic statistical research including mathematical statistics and probability theory.

\section{My specific interests and experiences in this field.}
The detailed information and documents of my Graduate class projects can be found at my personal home page \footnote{\url{http://yongsen.github.com}}.

Performance Evaluation of Zigbee Networks based on NS2, written in Otcl and Gawk\footnote{Home page: \url{http://yongsen.github.com/ns2_zigbee}, Source code: \url{https://github.com/yongsen/ns2_zigbee}}.


Developed an Um interface monitoring system for GSM/GSM-R networks\footnote{Home page: \url{http://yongsen.github.com/um_monitoring}, Source code: \url{https://github.com/yongsen/um_monitoring}}, deployed on PC/104
platform and Windows XP Embedded system, written in C\# based on Microsoft .NET Compact Framework, tested along Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

Developed a performance measurement application for mobile 802.11n networks\footnote{Home page: \url{http://yongsen.github.com/graded_802.11n}, Source code: \url{https://github.com/yongsen/graded_802.11n}}, deployed on Atheros WiFi devices and Linux system, written in Linux C based on wireless driver ath9k and Linux wireless extension, tested in laboratory and dormitory sceneries.
